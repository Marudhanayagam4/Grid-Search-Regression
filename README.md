## Predicting Insurance Charges
This project aims to predict insurance charges using various machine learning models. The models were tuned using GridSearchCV, both with and without training and testing inputs.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates insurance charges based on several input features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. Multiple machine learning models were applied, including:

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Basic linear model.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Includes tuning for kernel types.
- **Decision Tree**: Adjusted for max depth, min samples split, etc.
- **Random Forest**: Tuned for number of estimators and max depth.
