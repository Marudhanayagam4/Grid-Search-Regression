## Predicting Insurance Charges
This project aims to predict insurance charges using various machine learning models. The models were tuned using GridSearchCV, both with and without training and testing inputs.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates insurance charges based on several input features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. Multiple machine learning models were applied, including:

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Basic linear model.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Includes tuning for kernel types.
- **Decision Tree**: Adjusted for max depth, min samples split, etc.
- **Random Forest**: Tuned for number of estimators and max depth.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features that could influence insurance charges, such as:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Children
- Smoker status
- Region
- Charges (Target variable)

## Methodology

## 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Description of how missing data, if any, was handled.
- **Feature Scaling**: Explanation of how feature scaling was applied, if applicable.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Brief on how categorical variables were handled.
  
## 2. Model Building
For each model (Multiple Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest), GridSearchCV was employed to find the optimal hyperparameters. The models were trained and tested on the dataset to predict the insurance charges.

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Hyperparameters tuned with and without training/testing splits.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Grid search applied to tune kernel types and other hyperparameters.
- **Decision Tree**: Tuning of max depth, min samples split, etc.
- **Random Forest**: Tuning of the number of estimators, max depth, etc.
  
## 3. Model Evaluation
- **R² Score**: The primary evaluation metric used to assess the performance of each model.
- **Training vs. Testing Performance**: Comparisons of model performance on both training and testing datasets.

  
## Results
- **Best Model**: The model that performed the best in terms of R² score.
- **Best Parameters**: The optimal hyperparameters found using GridSearchCV.
- **Model Comparison**: A brief summary of how each model performed.

## Future Work
- **Feature Engineering**: Adding or transforming features to improve model performance.
- **Model Optimization**: Exploring advanced models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the best model to a web service for real-time predictions.
