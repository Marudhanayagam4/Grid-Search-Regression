## Predicting Insurance Charges
This project aims to predict insurance charges using various machine learning models. The models were tuned using GridSearchCV, both with and without training and testing inputs.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates insurance charges based on several input features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. Multiple machine learning models were applied, including:
- Multiple Linear Regression
